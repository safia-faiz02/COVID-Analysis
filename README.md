# COVID-Analysis
This project was issued to me by CodeClause, where I interned.
The conclusion that I've drawn out from the analysis is that:
- The country with the most deaths is **USA**, with 16.6% of the total of all the country's death included in this dataset. 
- The country with the least deaths is **Western Sahara** (as the country names are listed numerically, can't be seen in the dataset as the value is VERY small)
- The country with the most contributing proportion in this data set is **USA** with the total of 1118158870 tests (as per dataset).
- The country with the least contributing proportion is **Soloman Island** with the total of 5117 tests (as per dataset).
- The country with the most cases identified and recovered is **USA**, with approximately 98M people getting listed as being COVID +ve and approximately 94M people recovered as well (as per dataset).
- The country with the least cases identified and recovered is **Western Sahara**, with 10 people getting listed as being COVID +ve and 9 people recovered as well (as per dataset).
